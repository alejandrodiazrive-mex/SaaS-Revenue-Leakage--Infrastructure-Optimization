Honda Service Center: Operational Efficiency & Revenue Recovery Analysis
📊 SQL-Based Financial Audit & Capacity Optimization
Author: Alejandro Diaz Role: Data Analyst | Business Intelligence Focus Location: Mexico (Open for Remote Work)

🚀 Executive Summary
This project analyzes 4 years of historical service data (12,286 records) from a Honda Dealership to identify operational inefficiencies and revenue leakage.

The analysis reveals that 35% of the customer base lacks valid contact information, creating a significant barrier to retention. Through financial modeling, I estimated a total revenue exposure of ~$526k USD.

Using a scenario-based approach, this repository provides a SQL-driven strategy to potentially recover $79k USD (Realistic Scenario) by optimizing data capture and repurposing underutilized afternoon shifts.

🛡️ Data Quality Audit & Constraints
Before the financial analysis, a rigorous data integrity check was performed (see 00_data_quality_checks.sql).

| Audit Check | Status | Impact / Decision |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Temporal Consistency** | ✅ Pass | 0 records found outside the analysis scope (2022-2026). |
| **Negative Billable Hours** | ⚠️ Minor Warning | 3 records found with <= 0 hours. Excluded from financial sums. |
| **Invalid Phone Formats** | ❌ **High Risk** | **498 records** identified with invalid lengths (<10 digits), in addition to NULL values. |
| **Duplicate Candidates** | ℹ️ Constraint | Multiple same-model entries per day. **Decision:** Treated as distinct services due to lack of VIN. |

💰 Financial Impact & Recovery Scenarios
Instead of assuming a total loss, I modeled three recovery scenarios based on a standard ticket of $120 USD applied to the 4,385 contactable-at-risk clients.

| Scenario | Recovery Rate | Estimated Revenue Recovery (USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pessimistic** | 5% | $26,310.00 |
| **Realistic** | 15% | $78,930.00 |
| **Optimistic** | 30% | $157,860.00 |

Note: Projections are based on historical service frequency and standard pricing proxies.

🔑 Key Operational Findings
1. The "Ghost Client" Phenomenon
Insight: 1,576 unique customers have no registered phone number, and another ~500 have invalid numbers.

Impact: The CRM cannot trigger automatic service reminders for these clients, directly increasing churn risk in the CR-V and HR-V segments (our most valuable assets).

2. "Dead Rent" & Capacity Utilization
Insight: The workshop operates at High Saturation before 12:00 PM but drops to <10% utilization in the afternoon.

Financial Risk: Fixed costs (Rent/Staff) remain constant while revenue generation plummets after lunch.

Recommendation: Shift "Express Services" (Oil/Filters) specifically to afternoon slots to balance the daily load.

🛠️ Repository Structure
This project moves from data profiling to actionable financial logic using PostgreSQL.

F| File | Description | Business Logic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **00_data_quality_checks.sql** | Data Audit | Validates data integrity (dates, duplicates, phone formats). |
| **01_capture_audit.sql** | Leakage Diagnosis | Calculates financial loss per advisor due to missing data. |
| **02_operational_capacity.sql** | Efficiency Analysis | Segments shifts to identify idle capacity ("Dead Rent"). |
| **03_product_mix_analysis.sql** | Market Fit | Identifies "Star Models" (CR-V & HR-V) using RANK(). |
| **04_strategic_retention.sql** | Actionable List | High-value customers inactive for >180 days. |
| **05_scenario_analysis.sql** | Financial Modeling | Revenue recovery projections (5%, 15%, 30%). |

⚖️ Proposed Strategic Actions
Based on the data, the following trade-offs are recommended for management review:

Volume vs. Data Quality: Advisors prioritizing speed are skipping data entry.

Action: Link monthly bonuses to a 90% Contactability Rate.

Agility vs. Analytics: The use of "Free Text" fields speeds up reception but hinders analysis.

Action: Implement standard drop-down service codes in the DMS.

Capacity Balancing:

Action: Offer a 10% discount for customers willing to book appointments after 2:00 PM to reduce morning congestion.

💻 Technical Stack
SQL (PostgreSQL): Advanced aggregation, Window Functions (RANK), CTEs, CASE WHEN logic.

Data Cleaning: Handling NULL values, regex for phone validation, and string normalization (ILIKE).

Business Intelligence: KPI Definition (Churn Risk, Revenue Leakage, Utilization Rate).
